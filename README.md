# Flashing-Light-PCB-Using-555-Timer
My first PCB! Created for UBC Formula Electric to indicate when the tractive system is on.
The circuit uses a 555 timer chip operating in astable mode to generate a square wave output. 
This output is fed to the base of a BJT which then turns on 6 red LED lights. The circuit also ha 5 green LED lights, which are connected to another transistor, this time triggered by the green enable wire.
This project, made using Altium Designer, contains the schematic and PCB layout of the circuit.
